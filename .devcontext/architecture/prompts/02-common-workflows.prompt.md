Title: Common workflows playbook (task-centric)

Goal
- Create short, copy-pastable guides for key workflows:
  1) Run inference with pipelines
  2) Train with Trainer
  3) Add a new model (high-level pointers)
  4) Publish to Hub
  5) Export to ONNX

Deliverables
- A markdown doc with 5 sections, each 10â€“20 lines, minimal code blocks.

- Point to key code and docs for deeper dives.

Output
- Write to `.devcontext/architecture/onboarding/02-common-workflows.md` (include the numeric prefix to ensure natural sorting).
